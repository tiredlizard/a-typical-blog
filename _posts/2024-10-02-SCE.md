<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">S</span>o, you woke up this morning and wondered "what in the heck is an SCE object?". Just kidding, no one does that. That's why I'm here to tell you about something most people never use! .</p>

### What is the SCE object?

I'll start with the basic basics. SCE stands for 'Single-Cell Experiment' and, you guessed it, contains biological data for cells. "Why would you want to work with biological data?" you ask. "Because I'm a masochist," I answer. No, I'm a biostatistican, but same difference. At least I'm not an actuary.

### Where is the SCE object?

Biomanager.

### Why is the SCE object?

Yes, I'm ignoring proper grammar for the joke. Also, since I'm a Statistcian(TM), I shouldn't be able to spell. Something something RNA stuff.

### How is the SCE object?

Alright, I admit, it's getting old. But the structure of the Single-Cell Experiment is very important, and probably one of the most difficult things to explain.

Oh, nevermind. It was pretty easy!

### Who is the -- okay, I'll stop now.
I know, I'm hilarious. ...this is probably why no one will hire me, huh.



### Code chunk!

{%- highlight python -%}
def print_hi(name):
  print("Hi" + name)
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom'.
{%- endhighlight -%}
