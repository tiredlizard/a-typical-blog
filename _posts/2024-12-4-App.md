<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>elcome back, unfortunate souls. Last time (...on Avatar), we walked through the gathering and cleaning of some data from Moby Games, a website purely for collecting and managing game information. We did some basic EDA and thought a few things looked interesting. Now, onto part two of this thrilling saga (/s). </p>

### Key Insights?
Honestly, there wasn't anything jaw-dropping or super amazing in the data, at least not that I found. I mean, here's a boxplot if you want it.

</figure>

A majority of the games were rated in the 7.9-8.2 range. Since these games are the top 500 from the Moby list of Nintendo Switch games, that doesn't surprise me. Action seems to have the most outliers, though none of the genres have a Moby score (a "number based on a bayesian scale critic and plater ratings") above 9.4. But we all know what critics are like, so again, that isn't a shocking development. 

Unsurprisingly, fantasy seemed to be the most popular genre among the games. The most common perspectives among the genres were third-person and side view. (So, not Minecraft.)

In my previous post, I mentioned that there was a noticeable drop off where there weren't as many games being released in 2020. Take a guess as to why. (Oddly enough, the one gambling game I have in my dataset was released in 2020. Go figure?) This is easily seen in the 'Explore' tab of my streamlit app, specifically the first graph. But that's a topic for another time. Wait, that's a perfect transition.

### (N)App Time

I present to you... [Playing with Game Data](https://geepersitsgamedata.streamlit.app), the app. I know, the name's so clever. Hilarious.

#### Tab 1
It's relatively self-explanatory. The first tab is just a few widgets for people to mess around with to their heart's content, aka for ten seconds. For the first plot, you select a genre and it displays a simple graph depicting the number of games released per year in that genre.

<figure>

</figure>

As the title says, I selected 'Role-playing (RPG)' from the genre list and got this lovely little curve back.

The second plot is a stacked bar graph. You can select multiple game settings (as in world setting, not interface settings) and they'll show up on the bar graph, stacked on top of one another. If you hover your cursor over a bar, it'll tell you the exact count of each setting per year.

</figure>

I selected my favorite settings and got this lovely thing.

Then there's release month, which isn't really useful but is kinda fun to slide the dot around. As I mentioned previously, April has the least amount of releases, with only 26/500 games being released on the Switch that month. 

#### Tab 2
This one's my favorite. You select a genre, one or more gameplay options, a setting, and a minimum critic score to see a dataframe of all the games that match your criteria. Since my dataset is pretty limited, it's not as cool as it seemed in my head. Oh well. 

#### Tab 3
Unfortunately, this widget ended up being difficult to use considering how case sensitive it is. If you miss an apostrophe or space, it's over (for a second).
