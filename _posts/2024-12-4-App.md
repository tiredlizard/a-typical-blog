Unsurprisingly, Fantasy seemed to be the most popular genre among the games. 

Honestly, there wasn't anything jaw-dropping or super amazing in the data, at least not that I found. I mean, here's a boxplot if you want it.

A majority of the games were rated in the 7.9-8.2 range. Since these games are the top 500 from the Moby list of Nintendo Switch games, that doesn't surprise me. Action seems to have the most outliers, though none of the genres have a Moby score (a "number based on a bayesian scale critic and plater ratings") above 9.4. But we all know what critics are like, so again, that isn't a shocking development.
