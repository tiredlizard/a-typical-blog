Unsurprisingly, Fantasy seemed to be the most popular genre among the games. 


###Key Insights?
Honestly, there wasn't anything jaw-dropping or super amazing in the data, at least not that I found. I mean, here's a boxplot if you want it.

A majority of the games were rated in the 7.9-8.2 range. Since these games are the top 500 from the Moby list of Nintendo Switch games, that doesn't surprise me. Action seems to have the most outliers, though none of the genres have a Moby score (a "number based on a bayesian scale critic and plater ratings") above 9.4. But we all know what critics are like, so again, that isn't a shocking development. 

In my previous post, I mentioned that there was a noticeable drop off where there weren't as many games being released in 2020. Take a guess as to why. (Oddly enough, the one gambling game I have in my dataset was released in 2020. Go figure?) This is easily seen in the 'Explore' tab of my streamlit app, specifically the first graph. But that's a topic for another time. (Give me two paragraphs.)

###(N)App Time

I present to you... [Playing with Game Data](https://geepersitsgamedata.streamlit.app), the app. I know, it's so clever. I'm exhausted leave me alone.

It's relatively self-explanatory. The first tab is just a few widgets for people to mess around with to their heart's content, aka for ten seconds. For the first plot, you select a genre and it displays a simple graph depicting the number of games released per year in that genre.

As the title says, I selected 'Role-playing (RPG)' from the genre list and got this lovely little curve back.

The second plot is a stacked bar graph. You can select multiple game settings (as in world setting, not interface settings)
