<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">S</span>o, you woke up this morning and wondered "what in the heck is an SCE object?". Just kidding, no one does that. That's why I'm here to tell you about something you've never even heard about. My fellow students, don't be too alarmed by the '11 Minute Read'; you can skim it in, like, two minutes. (I'm very sorry.) </p>
