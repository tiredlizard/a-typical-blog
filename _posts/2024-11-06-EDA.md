## Intro



## Motivating Q
I wouldn't consider myself a Gamer (derogatory), but I do love playing video games. My Nintendo Switch and I have spent quite a bit of time together. When I was looking for datasets to collect, I came across the Moby Video Games website and thought 'why not?'. I was curious to see what attributes give games higher ratings than others; i.e. does the type of genre or interface make a difference? Were there more popular games released in a particular year? What impact did COVID-19 have on games (if any)?

## Summary of steps
Grabbing the first part of the data was easy, especially since it was a table - just same basic BeautifulSoup coding and I had it. But the second part was a pain in the butt. It was technically a grid object, but the find functions could not fulfill their one purpose in life. `<dd>` and `<dl>` tags don't like cooperating, apparently. So ChatGPT and I talked over dinner, and breakfast, and lunch... literally for hours to figure out how to extract that data I wanted. Once we figured that out, we had to do something even worse - clean the data. Honestly, it was a nightmare. Luckily for you, if you're interested in scraping a similar website, you have code now. Congrats. 


## Summary stats
Unfortunately, my dataset is only games from the Nintendo Switch, and I couldn't exactly grab all 12,500 games on the bestsellers list before Moby drop-kicked me out of their servers. I ended up with 550 games and collected 10 features for each of them (exluding the title).
