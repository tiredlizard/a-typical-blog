## The Question
I wouldn't consider myself a Gamer (derogatory), but I do love playing video games. My Nintendo Switch and I have spent quite a bit of time together. When I was looking for datasets to collect, I came across the Moby Games website and thought 'why not?'. I was curious to see what attributes give games higher ratings than others; i.e. does the type of genre or interface make a difference? Were there more popular games released in a particular year? What impact did COVID-19 have on games (if any)? 


## The Ethics
Before you ask - yes, I did check the robots.txt file. It allowed me to access all the content I needed. Since I didn't extract any names or personal info, I figured it'd be alright to share my data on the GitHub repository. If you happen to be the esteemed Moby of Moby Games and would like me to terminate my repo, email me `:)`. 

## The Steps
Grabbing the first part of the data was easy, especially since it was a table - just same basic BeautifulSoup coding and I had it. But the second part was a pain in the butt. It was technically a grid object, but the find functions could not fulfill their one purpose in life. `<dd>` and `<dl>` tags don't like cooperating, apparently. So ChatGPT and I talked over dinner, and breakfast, and lunch... we chatted (well, mostly I pleaded for help and it patiently responded) for hours to figure out how to extract the data I wanted. 

Once that was figured out, I had to do something even worse: clean the data. Honestly, it was a nightmare. Whitespace, parentheses, commas, slashes, lions, tigers, and bears - I needed to clear out almost everything. Simple, right? Yes, but I also needed to turn each value in most of my columns into lists. Rather than 'Fantasy, Sci-fi / futuristic", I wanted [Fantasy, Sci-fi / futuristic] so I could properly analyze the data. I'll spare you the rest of the details


Luckily for you, if you're interested in scraping a similar website, you have (exceedingly complicated) code in the repo linked at the bottom. Congrats. 


## The Dataset

Unfortunately, my dataset is only games from the Nintendo Switch, and I couldn't exactly grab 11,774 games on the master list before Moby drop-kicked me out of their servers. So I ended up with 550 games and collected 12 features: 

-Title
-Release year
-Release date
-Moby Score (Ranking)
-Genre
-Critics Score (Percentage)
-Perspective
-Gameplay
-Interface
-Setting
-ESRB Rating
-Multiplayer Options  

After checking for missing values, I dropped the last two columns - they were missing 361 and 444 values, respectively, out of 550 total. 

Why did I keep 'Release year' *and* 'Release date'? Well, I collected the year before finding out about the date variable. I also wanted months, so I just grabbed the release date as well.

## The Stats, and the Plots I guess

The only numeric variables I had were the Moby Score and the Critics rating. 

{%- highlight python -%}
all_combined_df.describe()

            Score     Critics
count  550.000000  550.000000
mean     8.023273   84.336364
std      0.257217    3.365087
min      7.800000   77.000000
25%      7.900000   82.000000
50%      7.900000   84.000000
75%      8.100000   86.000000
max      9.400000   96.000000
{%- endhighlight -%}

Not particularly interesting, besides the sheer number of 0's the function felt the need to add.

Now for our first categorical variable: year released!

Well, that was underwhelming.

This one has far more interesting colors:

<figure>
	<img src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/cool_area_plot.png" alt=""> 
	<figcaption>Figure n. - A cool stacked plot of games released per genre per year.</figcaption>
</figure>

If you're unfamiliar with stacked area plots, they're pretty simple - the one with the largest area has the most counts. In this case, 'Action' (the blue one) has the most games of all the genres. Then each other genre is stacked on top of it until the total count for the year is reached. For example, in 2018 in this dataset, there were approximately 50 Action games released, 10 Adventure games released, etcetera. 

(Note the substantial dip in 2020 from both of these graphs. Unsurprising, but still neat to look at.)
